window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Child-rearing is a rewarding, beautiful, and amazing experience. But as a parent, there are dozens of frustrating and exasperating moments of self-doubt.</p> <p>Nicholas Provenzano gets it. He’s spent over 15 years in the classroom to shape problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. Oh, and he’s a dad, too.</p> <p>Follow Mr. Provenzano as he explores the science behind creativity and the different things that parents can do to support their children as they grow up. He starts by digging deep into the research of Abraham Maslow, laying the foundations for creativity by identifying the basic needs of every child.</p> <p>Once he’s established the baseline, Mr. Provenzano provides listeners with a robust set of tools to develop a child’s creative and inquisitive nature: from the importance of play—gameplay, unstructured play, sports, and even LEGO building sets—to suggestions for toys and activities that help children grow to be creators instead of just consumers.</p> <p>Further, Mr. Provenzano reveals ways to organize inside your home to support creativity, as well as provides listeners with reasons to get children playing outside of the home. Learn the benefits of allowing children to take a certain type of risk in order to become more resilient, and increase self-esteem and confidence. And listeners will discover \"Design Thinking\" as a way to explore problem solving and critical thinking during project-based learning.</p> <p>Beyond improving parenting skills and giving fewer moments of doubt, this course may even introduce listeners to strategies to help harness their own creativity and critical-thinking skills. This course is a “must-listen” for parents of children of all ages. </p>";
