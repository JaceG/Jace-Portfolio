window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most Americans these days consider entrepreneurship to be a good career. More than half of all American adults will start at least one business during their working life. Due to the shutdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, working from home became a common practice that many Americans would like to see as a permanent work option. This means that if you’re like most Americans, you’ve either already started your own business or you’re seriously considering it. If so, you’ve definitely come to the right place.</p> <p>In How to Turn Your Passion into Profit, business expert Tara McMullin will guide you through the process of creating your own business, turning some commonly held ideas completely upside down in the process. For example, you might think your first task would be to identify what you want to sell. Not so fast, Tara says. You think your goal should be to make as much money as possible, as quickly as possible? Think again.</p> <p>Instead of rushing headlong into selling a product, Tara suggests you take a step back to ask what you want to get out of this business. Yes, you certainly want to make money. But as Tara explains in five modules, there are some more important basic questions to ask yourself. For example, what are the guiding principles you live by and how can they be incorporated into your new business? Do you become animated with excitement when talking to groups of people or do you prefer one-on-one communication? Do you want to develop a business that can be supported by your local community face to face or would you be more excited by international sales? With Tara’s guidance, your answers to these and other questions will lead you to the appropriate business model and development of a successful long-term endeavor you will enjoy.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
