window.bookSummaryJSON = "Counter to traditional marketing wisdom, which tries to count, measure, and manipulate the spread of information, Seth Godin argues that information can spread most effectively from customer to customer, rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to-customer dialogue the ideavirus. In <i>Unleashing the Ideavirus</i>, Godin examines how companies like Napster and Hotmail have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a recipe for creating your own ideavirus, and shows how businesses can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that doesn't want to hear it anymore from traditional marketers.";
