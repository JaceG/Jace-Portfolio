window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>\"Hosts of all kinds, this is a must-read!\" (Chris Anderson, owner and curator of TED)</b></p> <p>From the host of the <i>New York Times </i>podcast <i>Together Apart</i>, an exciting new approach to how we gather that will transform the ways we spend our time together - at home, at work, in our communities, and beyond. </p> <p>In <i>The Art of Gathering</i>, Priya Parker argues that the gatherings in our lives are lackluster and unproductive - which they don't have to be. We rely too much on routine and the conventions of gatherings when we should focus on distinctiveness and the people involved. At a time when coming together is more important than ever, Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that will help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences, large and small, for work and for play. </p> <p>Drawing on her expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn't, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings - conferences, meetings, a courtroom, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp - and explains how simple, specific changes can invigorate any group experience. </p> <p>The result is a book that's both journey and guide, full of exciting ideas with real-world applications. <i>The Art of Gathering</i> will forever alter the way you look at your next meeting, industry conference, dinner party, and backyard barbecue - and how you host and attend them. </p>";
