window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When you think about Christian history, you might think of the first thousand years - the events of Jesus' life, the acts of the apostles, the establishment of the church, and the various councils that established theological doctrine. But the history of Christianity from the Reformation to the present is equally dramatic and profoundly relevant. It's a story about people as much as theology - our cultures, our politics, our relationship to the world. </p> <p><i>The History of Christianity II: From the Reformation to the Modern Megachurch</i> picks up where The Great Courses' first history of Christianity left off: with the Protestant Reformation. Over 36 fascinating lectures, Professor Molly Worthen of the University of North Carolina traces the story of Christianity as it transformed from a relatively homogenous entity at the end of the Middle Ages through the diverse global religion of today. </p> <p>While Professor Worthen gives you plenty of insight into theology, her primary focus is to place Christianity in its historical context. She personalizes history with stories of individual players and blends their narratives with larger trends give you the full history of momentous events, including the formation of myriad Protestant denominations, the Catholic Counter-Reformation, the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, the Cold War, and the spread of Christianity to Latin America, China, and South Korea. </p> <p>As you'll discover, Christianity has been at the center of momentous transformations around the globe and is now the largest religion in the world. Professor Worthen is a marvelous storyteller, and brings history to life through the stories of people across history - scientists and theologians, revolutionaries and social justice warriors, commentators and ordinary people living out the great drama of Christian history. From Martin Luther's 95 Theses to Latin American liberation theology, this is a magisterial course, and a must-have for students. </p>";
