It's about manipulating other people's greatest weakness: their desire for pleasure. </p> <p>Synthesizing the work of thinkers including Freud, Diderot, Nietzsche, and Einstein, reporting the enticing strategies of characters throughout history, <i>The Art of Seduction</i> is a comprehensive guide to getting what we want any way we can. </p>";
