window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When a group of former colonial rebels met at the Constitutional Convention, they knew they wanted to fix their broken government without recreating the English tyranny that had haunted them for decades. But were they prepared to create a brand-new system of government, the likes of which the world had never seen?</p> <p>The ideas on which the United States is founded are rich and diverse—and sometimes in tension with one another. Since our early history, Americans have sought to clarify those ideas and resolve those tensions through the Constitution, as well as the intricate body of law, traditions, and norms that have come to comprise our constitutional heritage. </p> <p>The history of the Constitution is therefore a history of ideas that define our country and our national identity—and it’s a fascinating and revealing story. </p> <p>The US Constitution Through History gives you the opportunity to explore the story of this powerful document, as well as the way our interpretation of it has evolved. In 24 riveting lectures, Professor Eric Berger of the University of Nebraska takes you on a journey through America’s constitutional history. He takes you inside the minds of the Framers and unpacks the ideas that led to the break from England. He then traces the evolution of those ideas through the schisms of the 19th century, the transformations of the 20th century, to our present era. To understand the United States today, we must understand how it has shaped and been shaped by this founding document that Americans have so long revered.</p> <p>Disclaimer: Please note that this recording may include references to supplemental texts or print references that are not essential to the program and not supplied with your purchase.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
