Don’t blame the tool for how some people have used it. If fully understood and harnessed effectively, power skills and understanding become the keys to increasing salaries, job satisfaction, career advancement, organizational change, and happiness. </p> <p>In <i>7 Rules of Power</i>, Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, provides the insights that have made both his online and on-campus classes incredibly popular—with life-changing results often achieved in 8 or 10 weeks. Rooted firmly in social-science research, Pfeffer’s 7 rules provide a manual for increasing your ability to get things done, including increasing the positive effects of your job performance. </p> <p>The 7 rules are: </p> <p></p> <ol> <li>Get out of your own way. </li> <li>Break the rules. </li> <li>Show up in powerful fashion. </li> <li>Create a powerful brand. </li> <li>Network relentlessly. </li> <li>Use your power. </li> <li>Understand that once you have acquired power, what you did to get it will be forgiven, forgotten, or both. </li> </ol> <p>With <i>7 Rules of Power</i>, you’ll learn, through both numerous examples as well as research evidence, how to accomplish change in your organization, your life, the lives of others, and the world.</p>";
