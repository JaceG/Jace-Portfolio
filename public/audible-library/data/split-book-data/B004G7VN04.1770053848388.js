From the viewpoint of an evolutionary biologist, he highlights the broadest movements both literal and conceptual on every continent since the Ice Age, and examines societal advances such as writing, religion, government, and technology. Diamond also dissects racial theories of global history, and the resulting work—<i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i>—is a major contribution to our understanding the evolution of human societies.";
