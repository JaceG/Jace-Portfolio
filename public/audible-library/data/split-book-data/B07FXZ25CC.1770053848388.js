window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There's a mantra real writers know but wannabe writers don’t. And the secret phrase is this: \"Nobody wants to read your shit.\" Recognizing this painful truth is the first step in the writer's transformation from amateur to professional. </p> <p>“When you understand that nobody wants to read your shit, you develop empathy. You acquire the skill that is indispensable to all artists and entrepreneurs - the ability to switch back and forth in your imagination from your own point of view as writer/painter/seller to the point of view of your reader/gallery-goer/customer. You learn to ask yourself with every sentence and every phrase: Is this interesting? Is it fun or challenging or inventive? Am I giving the reader enough? Is she bored? Is she following where I want to lead her?\"</p>";
