window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Would you like to stop beating yourself up and start harnessing the power of self-compassion? Wish you could take the risks you need to take to succeed? Want to unleash your creativity, increase your productivity, and rediscover the joy of knowing that you are enough?</p> <p>Here are 30 powerful exercises to help you override the “I-must-not-make-mistakes” mind-set of perfectionism.</p> <p>Whether you’re trying to avoid mistakes by over-performing - and burning out, or by avoiding challenging tasks and underperforming, avoidance brings, at best, short term anxiety relief. In the long run, you’re training the primordial limbic part of your brain - what Shannon calls the “monkey mind” - to trigger more and more anxiety about mistakes, undermining your confidence and making you more and more averse to the risk of others’ criticism.</p> <p>As Shannon’s clinical work with her anxious clients has proven again and again, we can’t change our thinking without changing our behavior. Using cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness principles, she has designed each exercise to not only undermine the “monkey chatter” that you can’t afford to make a mistake, but to create new experience that will build the self-acceptance and resilience you need to thrive in an imperfect world.</p> <p>The truth is, you are enough. You’re just going to have to experience it to believe it. So what are you waiting for? Get the workout and get started today!</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio. </b></p>";
