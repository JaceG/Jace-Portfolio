window.bookSummaryJSON = "Karl Marx's devastating critique of capitalism, and his proposal of communism as the answer to the failings of the capitalist system, bore their greatest fruits in the twentieth century with the formation of the communist state in the Soviet Union. This great venture has now all but completely failed. Yet the force of the communist belief offered the prospect of \"justice on this earth\" to countless numbers. And Marx's critique has influenced generations of thinkers who call themselves Marxists. <p> In <i>Marx in 90 Minutes</i>, Paul Strathern offers a concise, expert account of Marx's life and ideas, and explains their influence on man's struggle to understand his existence in the world. The book also includes selections from Marx's work, a brief list of suggested readings for those who wish to delve deeper, and chronologies that place Marx within his own age and in the broader scheme of philosophy.</p>";
