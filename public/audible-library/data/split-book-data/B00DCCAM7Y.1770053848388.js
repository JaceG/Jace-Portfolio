window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The history of the U.S. economy in the 20th century is far too interesting - and far too important to our future - to be dismissed with just a few stock explanations. These 10 fast-paced lectures introduce you to vital economic lessons learned in the last century to provide invaluable guidance for understanding the current economy. Each lecture focuses exclusively on one decade to provide you with a clear understanding of economic developments and outside influences on the U.S. economy. </p> <p>In some cases, you'll examine well-defined events like the creation of the Federal Reserve or the war in Vietnam. In other lectures, you'll explore larger societal shifts, such as the evolving role of women in the economy and changing consumption patterns. This decade-by-decade approach takes you deep inside America's memorable economic milestones. Among these: the U.S. trade surplus during World War I; the rise of the automobile industry in the 1920s; the mismanagement of monetary policy that led to the Great Depression; the Employment Act of 1946, which gave the federal government the responsibility to maintain high employment and economic growth; the strangling inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s; and more. </p> <p>Professor Taylor takes care to ensure that you can follow this course clearly regardless of your knowledge of economics. He uses historical examples and quotes from economists and other notables, and his use of economic reasoning often brings surprising insight. </p>";
