window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A candid guide for ambitious women who want to succeed without losing themselves in the process </p> <p>In <i>The Myth of the Nice Girl</i>, Fran Hauser deconstructs the negative perception of \"niceness\" that many women struggle with in the business world. If women are nice, they are seen as weak and ineffective, but if they are tough, they are labeled a bitch. </p> <p>Hauser proves that women don't have to sacrifice their values or hide their authentic personalities to be successful. Sharing a wealth of personal anecdotes and time-tested strategies, she shows women how to reclaim \"nice\" and sidestep regressive stereotypes about what a strong leader looks like. Her accessible advice and hard-won wisdom detail how to balance being empathetic with being decisive, how to rise above the double standards that can box you in, how to cultivate authentic confidence that projects throughout a room, and much more. </p> <p><i>The Myth of the Nice Girl</i> is a refreshing dose of forward-looking feminism that will resonate with smart, professional women who know what they want and are looking for real advice to take their careers to the next level without losing themselves in the process. </p>";
