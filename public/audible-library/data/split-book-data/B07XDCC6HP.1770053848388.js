window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p> No calculator? No problem! Whether a listener is prepping for a standardized test or just trying to figure out the check, mathematician Dr. Arthur Benjamin will teach listeners the fundamentals of mental addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. From there, listeners will turn to the art of \"guess-timation\" for problems that don’t require an exact answer. Listeners will learn:<br> </p> <ul> <li>Tricks and techniques to arrive at answers for large problems listeners can’t do in their heads. </li> <li>How to effectively memorize important digits, such as phone numbers, credit card pins, or the dreaded numerical call-in conference passcode.<br> </li> <li>Little-known math techniques, including over-subtraction and the cashier’s method.<br> </li> <li>Mastery multiplication tables through 20 and multiply a pair of 2-digit numbers.<br> </li> <li>How to think of numbers from left to right and hear the numbers without the need to visualize anything.<br> </li> <li>Tricks for adding and subtracting numbers as high as 4-digits and multiplying 2-digit numbers—without a calculator.<br> </li> <li>How to rely heavily on mental estimation and tricks for converting fractions and decimals.</li> </ul> <p>With Professor Benjamin’s engaging, fun-filled lessons, listeners soon find themselves amazing other people and, perhaps more important, themselves. Examples included in the lessons use real-world applications that apply to shopping, banking, tipping, cooking, gaming, gambling, and sports statistics. The skills learned in <i>No Calculator? No Problem!: Mastering Mental Math</i> will teach listeners the tools necessary to excel in school, personal finance, work, and life. Learn to allocate spending, manage time, and master life like a math whiz. </p>";
