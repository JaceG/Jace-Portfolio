window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Actor, voice actor, and comedian H. Jon Benjamin helps us all feel a little better about our own failures by sharing his own - despite his success starring on </b><b><i>Archer </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Bob's Burgers</i></b><b> - in a hilarious, self-helpful memoir.</b></p> <p>While he's not quite a household name, most people would consider H. Jon Benjamin, the voice-actor star of <i>Archer </i>and <i>Bob's Burgers</i> (and a sentient can of mixed vegetables in 2015's <i>Wet Hot American Summer</i>) a comedy show business success. But he'd like to remind everyone that as great as success can be, failure is also an option. In a hilarious, self-deprecating memoir, Jon lays out some of his many failures in all areas of life, from Work (\"wherein I'm unable to deliver a sizzling fajita\") to Family (\"wherein a trip to PF Chang's fractures a family\").</p> <p>Fans of his characters' signature wit and voice will rejoice in H. Jon Benjamin's comical failures - and appreciate a rare look into the life of the man behind their favorite shows.</p>";
