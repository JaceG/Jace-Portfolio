window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>This program is read by the author and includes a foreword written and read by Tony Robbins.<br> </b><br> In this newly revised and expanded edition of <i>The Emotion Code</i>, renowned holistic physician and lecturer Dr. Bradley Nelson skillfully lays bare the inner workings of the subconscious mind. He reveals how emotionally charged events from your past can still be haunting you in the form of \"trapped emotions\"—emotional energies that literally inhabit your body. These trapped emotions can fester in your life and body, creating pain, malfunction, and eventual disease. They can also extract a heavy mental and emotional toll on you, impacting how you think, the choices that you make, and the level of success and abundance you are able to achieve. Perhaps most damaging of all, trapped emotional energies can gather around your heart, cutting off your ability to give and receive love. <br> <br> <i>The Emotion Code</i> is a powerful and simple way to rid yourself of this unseen baggage. Dr. Nelson’s method gives you the tools to identify and release the trapped emotions in your life, eliminating your “emotional baggage,” and opening your heart and body to the positive energies of the world. Filled with real-world examples from many years of clinical practice, <i>The Emotion Code</i> is a distinct and authoritative work that has become a classic on self-healing.</p>";
