window.bookSummaryJSON = "<i>Purple Cow</i> was the number-one best-selling marketing book on Amazon in 2003. Now, in <i>Free Prize Inside</i>, Seth Godin is back with practical advice on how to put <i>Purple Cow</i> thinking to work inside your organization (big or small, profit or non) to make something happen. <p>The next big marketing idea is a proven strategy for making your products or services so remarkable that they practically sell themselves. <i>Purple Cow</i> taught marketers the value of standing out from the herd, which is how companies like Krispy Kreme and JetBlue made it big. But it left readers hungry for more: How do you actually think up new Purple Cows? And how do you get them adopted by risk-averse Brown Cow companies?</p> <p><i>Free Prize Inside</i> delivers those answers and much more. It's a fun guide to doing innovative marketing that really works when the traditional approaches have all stopped working.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, the best way to sell something was to advertise it on television. But today's consumers are cynical, and your product or service had better be more than just hype and clever advertising. Even better, it ought to come with a market-changing innovation - a free prize inside.</p> <p>You don't have to spend a fortune to create something cool that virtually sells itself. Think of simple but powerful innovations like the Tupperware party, Flintstones vitamins, G.I. Joe (a doll just for boys), Lucille Roberts (a gym just for women), and frequent flier miles. <i>Free Prize Inside</i> will teach you how to create those kinds of blockbusters at your own company without a bunch of MBA-brainwashed marketers. You don't have to be a genius - you just need curiosity, initiative, and a strategy for overcoming resistance when you champion your idea.</p> <p>We're all marketers now, no matter what our job titles. With Godin's help, we can find the free prize that will transform our companies.</p>";
