window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Sari Solden specializes in working with ADD adults and their partners. Her first book, Women with Attention Deficit Disorder, has sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide. Now, in <i>Journeys Through ADDulthood</i>, she takes a groundbreaking look at the emotional turmoil often precipitated by ADD and offers listeners roadmaps to richer, happier lives. </p> <p>Living with ADD affects the development of one's view of self, especially for those not diagnosed until adulthood, after an entire childhood of feeling \"different\" without knowing why. There are no quick fixes - Solden takes a longer view of the challenges and sees living with ADD as an ongoing internal process. <i>Journeys Through ADDulthood</i> is a step-by-step guide through three stages, or journeys: toward understanding your brain and your primary symptoms; toward discovering your true identity and embracing your uniqueness; and toward learning to share your true self to connect with others. </p> <p>Illuminating her points based on the real-life journeys of two men and two women, Solden offers self-help exercises at the end of each chapter to point the way around common roadblocks on the road to empowerment, self-fulfillment, and the realization of long-buried dreams and goals.</p>";
