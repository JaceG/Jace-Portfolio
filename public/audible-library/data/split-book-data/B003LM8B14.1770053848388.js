window.bookSummaryJSON = "Selections from Henry David Thoreau's <i>Walden</i> and <i>Civil Disobedience</i>, and Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Introduction to Thoreau\", \"Self-Reliance\", \"Nature\", \"The American Scholar\", \"Education\", and \"Politics\". Thoreau dedicated his life to preserving his freedom as a man and an artist. <i>Walden</i> is a record of his experiment in simple living, describing his basic existence, rich in contemplation of the wonders of nature and the ways of man. <i>Civil Disobedience</i> is a work of protest against government interference with individual liberty. Emerson offers insight into Thoreau and the forces that shaped his life in his Introduction. The other essays in this collection represent Emerson's most influential writings, capturing the essence of American Transcendentalism. <p></p>";
