window.bookSummaryJSON = "One of the two major philosophical traditions of the twentieth century was linguistic analysis, derived largely from Wittgenstein. The other, diametrically opposed, came from Heidegger, and its fundamental question was, \"What is the meaning of existence?\" For Heidegger, this question could not simply be \"analyzed away\". It was beyond the reach of logic or reason. It was the primary \"given\" of every individual life. To confront it, Heidegger needed to develop an entire new form of philosophy. <p> In <i>Heidegger in 90 Minutes</i>, Paul Strathern offers a concise, expert account of Heidegger's life and ideas, and explains their influence on man's struggle to understand his existence in the world. The book also includes selections from Heidegger's work, a brief list of suggested readings for those who wish to delve deeper, and chronologies that place Heidegger within his own age and in the broader scheme of philosophy.</p>";
