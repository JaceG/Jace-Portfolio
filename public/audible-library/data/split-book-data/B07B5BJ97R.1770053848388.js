window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jordan B. Peterson's <i>Maps of Meaning</i> is now available for the first time as an audio download! </p> <p>Why have people from different cultures and eras formulated myths and stories with similar structures? What does this similarity tell us about the mind, morality, and structure of the world itself? From the author of <i>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</i> comes a provocative hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what rituals, myths, and religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology, cognitive science, and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative, <i>Maps of Meaning</i> presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
