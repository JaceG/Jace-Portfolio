window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Carol Loomis first mentioned a little-known Omaha hedge-fund manager in a 1966 <i>Fortune</i> article, she didn’t dream that Warren Buffett would one day be considered the world’s greatest investor - nor that she and Buffett would become close personal friends. As Buf­fett’s fortune and reputation grew, Loomis used her unique insight into Buffett’s thinking to chronicle his work for <i>Fortune</i>, writ­ing and proposing scores of stories that tracked his many accomplishments - and his occa­sional mistakes. </p> <p>Now Loomis has collected and updated the best Buffett articles <i>Fortune</i> published between 1966 and 2012, including thirteen cover stories and a dozen pieces authored by Buffett himself. Loomis has provided commentary about each major arti­cle that supplies context and her own informed point of view. Listeners will gain fresh insights into Buffett’s investment strategies and his thinking on management, philanthropy, public policy, and parenting. Some highlights include: </p> <ul> <li>The 1966 A. W. Jones story in which <i>Fortune</i> first mentioned Buffett </li> <li>The first piece Buffett wrote for <i>Fortune</i>, 1977’s \"How Inflation Swindles the Equity Investor\" </li> <li>Andrew Tobias’ 1983 article “Letters from Chairman Buffett,” the first review of his Berk­shire Hathaway shareholder letters </li> <li>Buffett’s stunningly prescient 2003 piece about derivatives, \"Avoiding a Mega-Catastrophe\" </li> <li>His unconventional thoughts on inheritance and philanthropy, including his intention to leave his kids \"enough money so they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing\" </li> <li>And Bill Gates’ 1996 article describing his early impressions of Buffett as they struck up their close friendship </li> </ul> <p>Scores of Buffett books have been written, but none can claim this work’s combination of trust between two friends, the writer’s deep under­standing of Buffett’s world, and a very long-term perspective.</p>";
