window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This book details key property and casualty concepts rarely discussed or found in print; rather, they are often left to be \"discovered\" over time. These important concepts are now written down for all insurance practitioners to easily access.</p> <p>Examples of the topics and concepts found in this book include rules for reading <i>any </i>insurance policy, why losses are excluded, contractual risk transfer, legal liability theories, \"COPE\" details, and the proper explanation of coinsurance concepts. Also included is a rather extensive glossary of insurance and insurance-related terms. </p> <p>Listeners will gain a deeper understanding of insurance theories, be better prepared to explain insurance concepts to their clients, and develop a greater appreciation and understanding of the claims valuation process.</p>";
