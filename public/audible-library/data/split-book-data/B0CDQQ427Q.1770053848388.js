In a first, Hoffman doesn’t just write about GPT-4; he interacts and writes <i>with</i> GPT-4, letting readers see the technology’s capabilities—its strengths and limitations alike. Using GPT-4 as his “author’s co-pilot,” Hoffman paints an intriguing, challenging, and often entertaining picture of what’s possible: where trouble may arise, but also crucially, what could possibly go right. His conversation with AI takes us on a journey to the future, where AI is not a threat, but a partner. A partner that can help us unlock our full potential as human beings.<br> <br> How might humanity use GPT-4 to continue our long-standing quest to make life more meaningful and prosperous? How can we use it to help solve some of the hardest challenges we face? To expand opportunities for self-determination and self-expression?<br> <br> Along with solutions and opportunities, GPT-4 will also create its own challenges and uncertainties. <i>Impromptu</i> explores how we might address risk as we continue to develop AI technologies that can boost human progress at a time when the need for rapid solutions at scale has never been greater. <i>Impromptu</i> starts the conversation, and invites us to join that conversation to shape our collaborative journey and achieve our destiny.</p>";
