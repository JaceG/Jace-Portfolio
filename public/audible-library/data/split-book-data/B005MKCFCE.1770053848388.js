window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Celebrating the 75 anniversary of the original landmark bestseller <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>, comes an up-to-the-minute adaptation of Carnegie’s timeless prescriptions for the digital age. </p> <p>Dale Carnegie’s principles have endured for nearly a century. Since its original publication in 1936, his timeless classic <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> has gone on to sell 15 million copies. Now, introducing new listeners to Carnegie’s words of wisdom, comes <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age</i>, a new guide for a new era. </p> <p>Dale Carnegie could never have predicted the trajectory that new media would take, and the ways that the simple television screen would be adapted into computers and handheld communication devices. He didn’t know the term “social media” and Facebook was something not even dreamed of in Buck Rogers cartoons. And yet his lessons remain relevant for everyone who communicates online today. In fact, with problems such as cyber bullying and email etiquette, we need Carnegie’s help more than ever. Dale Carnegie and Associates, Inc. has re-imagined Carnegie’s lasting lessons for this difficult digital age, reframing Carnegie’s insights about communication, self-expression, and leadership. This book is a must-have guide for anyone who wants to find success on Facebook, Linked-In, Twitter, and any social media format today and in the future. </p>";
