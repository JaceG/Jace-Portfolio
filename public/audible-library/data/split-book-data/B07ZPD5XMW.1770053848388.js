window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Energy medicine. Acupuncture. Superfoods. Healing magnets. What does the scientific evidence really say about these and other \"alternative medicine\" treatments for personal wellness?</p> <p>How can we know if a natural remedy is safe and effective? How can people become their own best skeptical consumer of health news in the media? Join neurologist and science educator Dr. Steven Novella for a fascinating exploration of these and other important questions about the truths—and myths—behind alternative medicine.</p> <p>Perhaps the most important skill to have in this brave new world of ever-changing medical news is the ability to evaluate sources and information, and to think critically about how alternative medicine is marketed, regulated, and used. Dr. Novella takes a rigorous, science-based approach in exploring so-called \"popular\" and \"cutting-edge\" trends. Armed with this knowledge, listeners will be in a much better position to assess alternative pathways to physical health.</p> <p>Dr. Novella’s 10 leading-edge lectures will answer such questions as:</p> <ul> <li>Do magnetic fields really have useful biological properties?</li> <li>Why is chiropractic treatment no more effective for pain management than simple physical therapy? </li> <li>Can brain games truly make one smarter or help in staving off dementia?</li> <li>Can homeopathic remedies, such as those derived from plants and minerals, really cure ailments?</li> <li>Does cupping therapy really help to reduce pain and inflammation, while increasing blood flow?</li> </ul> <p>Dr. Novella provides insights on the ever-widening gap between alternative medicine and scientific medicine, giving listeners the confidence they need to become their own best health advocates.</p>";
