window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It is impossible to understand our world today without understanding the last 100 years of Middle Eastern history. The history of the region in the 20th century is so varied and complex that it defies easy explanations. Shifting borders, governmental overthrows, ethnic and nationalist tensions, and political and economic forces on the world stage all had a hand in shaping the course of Middle Eastern history. Ultimately, however, the story is one of people searching for self-determination, from the stumbling alliances after the fall of the Ottoman Empire to the Arab Spring uprisings.</p> <p>Now that we have some historical distance from the tumultuous 20th century, it is a great time to take a historical deep dive into the history of the region. <i>The Middle East in the 20th Century</i> offers a marvelous introduction to this story and sheds an important light on the geopolitical stage today. Taught by author and Arabist Eamonn Gearon, these 24 enlightening and well-thought-out lessons bring clarity to a convoluted region and linear organization to a multifaceted story.</p> <p>These lessons introduce you to the people, places, and leaders over the ages, and over the course, Eamonn revisits several significant events from different perspectives, including the role of the British in shaping the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire, the formation of Israel, and the US-Soviet Cold War conflicts playing out in this period. International forces had a particularly strong impact on the history of the Middle East and North Africa. For instance, the discovery of oil in Iran in 1908 set in motion a series of alliances and conflicts ranging from the Suez Crisis of 1956 to the oil shocks of the 1970s to the 21st-century wars in Iraq and Syria.</p> <p>Sometimes inspiring, sometimes tragic, and always fascinating, <i>The Middle East in the 20th Century</i> is an absolute must for anyone who wants to understand our world today. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
