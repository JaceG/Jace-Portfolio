window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Well-known names of Christian saints include St. Peter, to whom Jesus gave the keys to the kingdom in the Bible; St. Joan of Arc, who led France to victory in the Hundred Years War; and St. Thomas Aquinas, whose philosophy around faith and reason, the existence of God, and the nature of the soul is embedded deeply in Church theology today. Lesser-known saints, who’ve been immortalized for the miracles attributed to them and the struggles they endured, include the names of Kateri Tekakwitha, Absalom Jones, Josephine Butler, and many others.</p> <p>Who are these figures? Why were they canonized as saints? And what can they teach us today? Unpack these questions with The Surprising Lives of Christian Saints. Over the course of 24 in-depth lectures, Professor Emily Graham, an Associate Professor of History at Oklahoma State University, surveys the global history of Christian sainthood. As you’ll discover, the stories of Christian saints are not just fascinating—they’re also an integral part of Christian history. Through their lives, in particular moments of time, you can trace the historical context that shaped the Church over two millennia, meeting such figures as:</p> <p>• Mary Magdalen, an early saint who has been interpreted and reinterpreted countless times over the years;</p> <p>• Perpetua and Felicity, mothers and martyrs in fourth-century Carthage;</p> <p>• Francis of Assisi, a mendicant known for ministering to the poor;</p> <p>• Elizabeth Ann Seton, a convert and caretaker in the United States; and</p> <p>• Andre Rublev, an icon painter whose striking artwork married Byzantine and Russian influence.</p> <p>What these saints all have in common is that they were ordinary people who did extraordinary things, from negotiating political strife to championing the poor and the dispossessed. Whether you’re a history enthusiast, a devout Christian, or someone curious about sainthood, Professor Graham takes you on an enlightening journey through time, revealing the profound lives of individuals who’ve left an indelible mark on our world.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
