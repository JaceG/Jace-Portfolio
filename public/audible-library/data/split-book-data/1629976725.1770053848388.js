window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some of the most profound secrets about what it means to be human are now being revealed, thanks to the amazing tools of biotechnology. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, opened the book on the genetic instructions that go into making a human. Now other species are being studied at the same level of detail, providing astonishing insights into the whole range of life on Earth. </p> <p>In 24 thought-provoking lectures designed for nonscientists, this course explores today's exciting field of genomics, the study of the vast storehouse of information contained within chromosomes. Your professor is Princeton University biologist Lee M. Silver, an acclaimed teacher, scientist, and author of popular books on biotechnology, genetics, and their impact on society. </p> <p>Enlivened by Dr. Silver's clear and enthusiastic presentation, this course is an unrivaled opportunity to investigate this dramatic new picture of our past, present, and future as a species. You’ll begin by surveying the history of ideas about life and inheritance, then peer into the human genome to read its code, compare it with the genomes of other species, and trace how information is translated into individual humans with all of our rich diversity. Then you’ll investigate topics like gene sequencing, FISH, the DNA microarray, and the molecular clock. Watching this very timely course, you will feel a sense of awe as you probe deeply and wondrously into the <i>Science of Self</i>.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
