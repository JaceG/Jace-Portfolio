window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>They’re not faster than a speeding bullet or able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. But that doesn’t mean steel-cut oats, blackberries, ginger, and other foods can’t swoop in to save the day - or at least our diets. </p> <p>Fiber, protein, micronutrients, and disease-fighting phytochemicals, superfoods like these have it all. And when combined with other healthy foods, they can improve blood sugar, cholesterol levels, and body mass index. And the best part about superfoods: They’re not trendy, eccentric, or impossible to find. They’re all tried-and-true, everyday ingredients that offer real nutritional benefits for any sort of diet imaginable. </p> <p>In <i>How Superfoods Work</i>, reevaluate the superfoods you are (or aren’t) eating and discover ways to make your life healthier - and more delicious. Delivered by chef and practicing physician Dr. Julia Nordgren, these 12 lessons reveal the nutrition science behind readily available superfoods, including dark chocolate (an indulgent way to eat healthy), miso (whose fermented nature promotes good gut health), and cashews (the perfect replacement for creamy elements in a recipe). Using her medical expertise, Dr. Nordgren explains how these and other superfoods work for our bodies; using her culinary expertise, she reveals quick and easy recipes to get more of these superfoods on your table. </p> <p>Want a more efficient metabolism? Looking to strengthen your body? Want a more rewarding relationship with mealtime? Chia seeds to the rescue! Or avocado! Or green tea! Or kale!</p>";
