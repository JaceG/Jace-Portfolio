window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>William James propounded his theories of pragmatism in this book. He emphasized \"radical empiricism\" and the concept that the meaning of any idea - philosophical, political, social, or otherwise - only has validity in terms of its experiential and practical consequences. He wished to test competing systems of thought in the \"marketplace of actual experience\" to determine whether adopting a particular philosophical theory or way of looking at the world makes an actual difference in individual conduct or in how people perceive and react to the varieties of experience.</p>";
