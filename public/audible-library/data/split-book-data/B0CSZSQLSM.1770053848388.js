From the messenger RNA (mRNA) technology deployed in the COVID-19 vaccines to new research into the biology of lichens to new theories about the inner workings of black holes, the 21st century has given us an exciting new understanding of ourselves, our world, and our universe.</p> <p>Now, you have the chance to dig into some of the most fascinating and important scientific advancements in recent years. Unexpected, consequential, and often counterintuitive, 12 Revolutionary Discoveries That Could Change Everything offers an inspiring introduction to science in the 21st century. Taught by Scientific American editor in chief Laura Helmuth, these eye-opening lectures will satiate even the most inquisitive mind.</p> <p>Laura sets the stage with what we used to know—for example, how the solar system was formed, how exercise promoted weight loss, or what dinosaurs may have looked like. She then surveys recent scientific literature to challenge our understanding of the world. We might think of science as a linear process—something is discovered, and that discovery leads to new developments—yet new insights occasionally contradict previous beliefs and send us in new directions.</p> <p>Indeed, the “discoveries that could change everything” are so important because they expand our knowledge or help us experience the world in even greater depth. In exploring these “paradigm shifts,” you’ll meet researchers from around the world, ranging from leaders in their fields to graduate students seeking to make their mark to ordinary naturalists with extraordinary abilities.</p> <p>From the chemical makeup of ocean particles to the way the brain perceives the world, Laura takes you into the fields of neuroscience, botany, paleontology, oceanography, astrophysics, and much more. Rich in stories that will please scientists and laypeople alike, this course truly is an intellectual smorgasbord of scientific disciplines.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
