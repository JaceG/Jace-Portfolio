It approaches the subject in the simplest and most direct way and is therefore best adapted as an introduction into his philosophy. It is not without good reasons that the appearance of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> is regarded as the beginning of a new era in the history of philosophy; and so it seems that a comprehension of Kant's position, whether we accept or reject it, is indispensable to the student of philosophy. It is not his solution which makes the sage of Königsberg the initiator of modern thought, but his formulation of the problem.</p>";
