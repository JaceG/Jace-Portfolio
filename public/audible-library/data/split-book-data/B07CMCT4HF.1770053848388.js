window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Critique of Practical Reason</i> was published in 1788, seven years after Immanuel Kant's major work, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>. </p> <p>In it, Kant sets out his moral philosophy - and it proved a seminal text in the history of the subject. He argues that the summum bonum (the highest good) of life is that rather than just pursuing happiness, people should inhabit a moral dimension that enables them to deserve the happiness that God can give. Though much shorter than <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, this is the sourcebook for Kant’s ethical doctrines. </p> <p>It is divided into five sections: Preface, Introduction, First Part: Elements of Pure Practical Reason, Second Part: Methodology of Pure Practical Reason, Conclusion. </p> <p>The translation is by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott.</p>";
