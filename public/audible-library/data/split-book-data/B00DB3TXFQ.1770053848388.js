window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What is a contract? How can you make one binding? How can you avoid being prematurely bound by one? What remedies are available if someone breaches your contract? These questions and the other important issues of legally enforceable promises are covered in these eight lectures. </p> <p> As you'll learn in these eight lectures, contractual agreements are one of the principal mechanisms for ordering life in society. Professor Cross lays a comprehensive foundation in the practical and intricate body of law that governs contracts. Throughout his expertly delivered lectures, he guides you through a range of topics and issues and helps you finally make better sense of business contracts-in all their seemingly overwhelming complexity. </p> <p>You'll explore the boundaries of contracts in law, including the four main requirements that any contract must satisfy. You'll unpack the Uniform Commercial Code of the United States, which incorporated common law about commercial contracts into state statutes. You'll learn about the main components of a contract (such as the preliminary issues of offer and acceptance, the definiteness of a contract's terms, and the ability of parties to negotiate). You'll also review problems associated with the performance and enforcement of a contract, including how much of a performance is required to consider a contract discharged and the categories of persons who are permitted to enforce agreements.
