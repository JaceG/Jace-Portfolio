window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>One of the most beloved and trusted mindfulness teachers in America offers a lifeline for difficult times: the RAIN meditation, which awakens our courage and heart.</b></p> <p>Tara Brach is an in-the-trenches teacher whose work counters today's ever-increasing onslaught of news, conflict, demands, and anxieties - stresses that leave us rushing around on auto-pilot and cut off from the presence and creativity that give our lives meaning. </p> <p>In this heartfelt and deeply practical audiobook, she offers an antidote: an easy-to-learn four-step meditation that quickly loosens the grip of difficult emotions and limiting beliefs. Each step in the meditation practice (<b>R</b>ecognize, <b>A</b>llow, <b>I</b>nvestigate, <b>N</b>urture) is brought to life by memorable stories shared by Tara and her students as they deal with feelings of overwhelm, loss, and self-aversion, with painful relationships, and past trauma - and as they discover step-by-step the sources of love, forgiveness, compassion, and deep wisdom alive within all of us.</p>";
