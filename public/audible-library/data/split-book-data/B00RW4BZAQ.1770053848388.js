window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Interstellar</i>, from acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan, takes us on a fantastic voyage far beyond our solar system. Yet in <i>The Science of Interstellar</i>, Kip Thorne, the physicist who assisted Nolan on the scientific aspects of <i>Interstellar</i>, shows us that the movie's jaw-dropping events and stunning, never-before-attempted visuals are grounded in real science. Thorne shares his experiences working as the science adviser on the film and then moves on to the science itself. </p> <p>In chapters on wormholes, black holes, interstellar travel, and much more, Thorne's scientific insights-many of them triggered during the actual scripting and shooting of <i>Interstellar</i> - describe the physical laws that govern our universe and the truly astounding phenomena that those laws make possible.</p>";
