window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Can we map success?</p> <p>Successful people typically don't plan their success. Instead they develop a unique philosophy or attitude that works for them. They stumble across strategies that are shortcuts to success and latch onto them. Events hand them opportunities they could not have anticipated. Often their peers with equal or greater talent fail while they succeed. It is too easy to attribute success to inherent, unstoppable genius.</p> <p>Best-selling author and serial entrepreneur Richard Koch charts a map of success, identifying the nine key attitudes and strategies that can propel anyone to new heights of accomplishment.</p> <p>With this book, you can embark on a journey toward a new, unreasonably successful future.</p>";
