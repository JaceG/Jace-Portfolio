window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Be everything you want to be! Dr. Maltz said to people of all ages: \"You are embarking on the greatest adventure of your life to improve your self-image, to create more meaning in your life and the lives of others. This is your responsibility. Accept it, Now!\" If you accept his challenge and his advice—you will become a more alert, alive human being. You'll never regret it. With the help of his wise and sympathetic words, this book, based on the principles of Psycho-Cybernetics, will help you gain new courage and self-confidence, overcome tension and stress, and give your life more meaning. You will greet each day with enthusiasm and hope, learn to turn a crisis into an opportunity and make every minute count. In addition, you will gain tools to help you learn to relax, build a better self-image, throw off fear and frustration and rise above failure.</p> <p>Dr. Maxwell Maltz (March 10, 1889-April 7, 1975) was an American cosmetic surgeon who created his self-improvement phenomenon, Psycho-Cybernetics, at age 61, after an already varied, colorful, and exceptionally successful career as a surgeon, writer, and speaker. Published in 1960, Psycho-Cybernetics has sold over 30 million copies since its original printing and remains a classic of self-help, self-improvement, and personal development. According to Dr. Maltz, the psycho-cybernetics process involves steering your mind to productive, valuable goals to reach peace of mind. In Psycho-Cybernetics and all the books that followed, Dr. Maltz speaks to the importance of a healthy self-image, which is the roadmap to creating a better quality of life.</p> <p>Dr. Maltz made his groundbreaking discovery when he realized his patients expected to feel happy after he gave them perfect new faces. However, it was the inner scars that still needed attention. Cosmetic surgery could not cure feelings of unhappiness, worthlessness, and insecurity. Dr. Maltz suggested that many people \"see themselves\" inaccurately, their perceptions distorted by unchallenged and often erroneous beliefs embedded in their subconscious minds. After counseling hundreds of patients with his evolving \"success conditioning techniques,\" Dr. Maltz published his findings, in 1960, in the original Psycho-Cybernetics.</p>";
