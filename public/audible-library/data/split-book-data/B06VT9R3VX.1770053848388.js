window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Do you or someone you care about experience episodes of extreme and unpredictable anger? Intense rages that threaten relationships, jobs, property - or worse? The first thing you need to know is that you are not alone. Researchers estimate that some seven percent of Americans may at some time experience a condition called intermittent explosive disorder (IED), which is characterized by reoccurring periods of extraordinary anger, and millions more have less frequent yet equally damaging experiences with rage. The second thing you need to know is that there is help. </p> <p>Rage can be calmed and controlled with good advice and a practical, effective plan for change. From renowned anger expert Ronald Potter-Efron, this book breaks down rage into four types: In survival rage, anger is triggered by a sense of danger or threat; feelings of helplessness can trigger impotence rage; the third type, abandonment rage, is triggered by a fear of losing a cherished relationship; and shame rage occurs when someone feels very disrespected. <i>Rage</i> briefly discusses how the brain functions during extreme emotion, and then it turns to the task of helping you stop episodes of rage - right now! In classic Potter-Efron style, the book places the responsibility for control squarely on the shoulders of the angry individual. There is no room in this dangerous situation for whys and becauses. Instead, <i>Rage</i> offers no-nonsense, step-by-step anger management tools that really work. </p>";
