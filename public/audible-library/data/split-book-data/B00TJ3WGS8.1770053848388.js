window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For <i>Epicurus</i>, the purpose of philosophy was to attain a happy, tranquil life, characterized by peace and freedom from fear, the absence of pain, and living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. </p> <p>He taught that pleasure and pain are the measures of what is good and evil; death is the end of both body and soul and should therefore not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events in the world are ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms. </p> <p>Although much of <i>Epicurus</i>' written work has been lost, his surviving principal doctrines form a complete foundation of his teaching. This audiobook adaptation features all 40 principles.</p>";
