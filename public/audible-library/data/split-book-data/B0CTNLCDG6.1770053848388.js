window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author of </b><b><i>Clear Thinking </i></b><b>and</b><b><i> </i></b><b>Farnam Street founder, Shane Parrish.</b></p> <p><b>The fourth and final installment in the timeless Great Mental Models series.</b></p> <p>Time and time again, great thinkers such as Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett have credited their success to mental models–representations of how something works that can scale onto other fields.</p> <p>Mastering a small number of mental models enables you to rapidly grasp new information, identify patterns others miss, and avoid the common mistakes that hold people back.</p> <p>Volume 4 of <i>The Great Mental Models</i> series delves into the realms of economics and art, presenting more than twenty-four valuable ideas with clear language and style. This book equips you with an understanding of the dynamics shaping our world. It will teach you strategies to leverage these principles and give you a significant edge in the aspects of life you value most.</p> <p>Some of the mental models covered in this book include:</p> <ul> <li><i>Creative destruction</i>: New innovations must sometimes come at the cost of maintaining the status quo.</li> <li><i>Representation</i>: The depiction of an idea can be visual, but it can also rely on symbols or other ideas.</li> <li><i>Genre</i>: Creative expressions tend to be grouped according to socially constructed norms; while a work can play with or bend genre, it can’t exist outside of genre.</li> </ul> <p><i>The Great Mental Models</i> series demystifies once elusive concepts and illuminates rich knowledge that traditional education overlooks. This series is the most comprehensive and accessible guide on using mental models to better understand our world, solve problems, and gain an advantage.</p>";
