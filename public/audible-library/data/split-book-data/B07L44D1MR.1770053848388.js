window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From a leading voice on recovering from toxic relationships, a deeply insightful guide to getting back to your \"old self\" again - in order to truly heal and move on.</b></p> <p>Jackson MacKenzie has helped millions of people in their struggle to understand the experience of toxic relationships. His first book, <i>Psychopath Free</i>, explained how to identify and survive the immediate situation. In this highly anticipated new audiobook, he guides listeners on what to do next - how to fully heal from abuse in order to find love and acceptance for the self and others.</p> <p>Through his work with thousands of survivors of abusive relationships, Jackson discovered that survivors frequently have symptoms of trauma lasting long after the relationship is over. These may include feelings of numbness and emptiness, depression, mood swings, isolation, perfectionism, rumination, caretaking and people-pleasing, a need for control, physical maladies, substance abuse, and more.</p> <p>But he also found that it is possible to work through these symptoms and find fulfillment and love on the other side. In <i>Whole Again</i>, he shares insights and tools for working through the protective self we've developed so that we can finally move on to live a full and authentic life - to once again feel light, free, whole, and ready to give and receive love.</p> <p>Like Brené Brown's <i>The Gifts of Imperfection</i> and John Bradshaw's <i>Healing the Shame that Binds You</i>, <i>Whole Again</i> offers hope and multiple strategies to anyone who has survived a toxic relationship, as well as anyone suffering the effects of a breakup involving lying, cheating, and other forms of abuse - to release old wounds and safely let the love back inside where it belongs.</p>";
