window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The follow-up to his best-seller <i>The War of Art</i>, <i>Turning Pro </i>navigates the passage from the amateur life to a professional practice. </p> <p>\"You don't need to take a course or buy a product. All you have to do is change your mind.\" (Steven Pressfield, author)</p> <p>Turning pro is free, but it's not easy. When we turn pro, we give up a life with which we may have become extremely comfortable. We give up a self we have come to identify with and to call our own. </p> <p>Turning pro is free, but it demands sacrifice. The passage from amateur to professional is often achieved via an internal odyssey whose trials are survived only at great cost, emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually. We pass through a membrane when we turn pro. It's messy, and it's scary. We tread in blood when we turn pro. </p> <p>What we get when we turn pro. What we get when we turn pro is we find our power. We find our will and our voice, and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had until then been afraid to embrace and live out.</p>";
