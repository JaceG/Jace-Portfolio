window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Following in the footsteps of the success of <i>The Completion Process</i>, best-selling author and modern spiritual leader Teal Swan offers an in-depth exploration and understanding of loneliness. Drawing on her extraordinary healing technique, the Connection Process, Teal offers a way to experience connection once again.</p> <p>Loneliness is reaching endemic proportions in our society, reflected by rising suicide rates and increased mental illness. Now, more than ever, we need to find a way to connect. Loneliness is a feeling of separation or isolation; it is not necessarily the same as the physical state of being alone. This book is for people who suffer from loneliness, the kind that cannot be solved by simply being around other people. Their aloneness is a deeply embedded pattern that is both negative and painful; it is often fueled by trauma, loss, addiction, grief, and a lack of self-esteem and insecurity. </p> <p>In <i>The Anatomy of Loneliness</i>, Teal identifies the three pillars or qualities of loneliness: separation, shame, and fear, and goes on to share her revolutionary technique, the Connection Process, a form of intuitive journeying, usually involving two people, a \"receiver\" and a \"journeyer\". Through a series of exercises, each person experiences \"walls\" and \"blockages\"; as they move through the process, both participants face their fears, learning from these to reach a place of unconditional love and acceptance.</p>";
