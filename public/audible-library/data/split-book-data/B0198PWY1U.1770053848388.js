window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> is one of the most extraordinary - and important - texts in Western philosophy. It was written by Friedrich Nietzsche between 1883 and 1885. He cast it in the form of a novel in the hope that his urgent message of the 'death of God' and the rise of the superman (Ubermensch) would have greater emotional as well as intellectual impact. </p> <p>Though tarnished somewhat by inappropriate adoption by the Nazi movement in the mid-20th century, <i>Zarathustra</i> remains an immensely important and influential work, particularly as it exhorts the individual to question standard conventions of society in order to pursue a truly ethical and spiritual path. </p> <p>After 10 years in solitude in the mountains, Zarathustra decides it is time to return to the world so that people can benefit from the fruits of his pondering: 'I would like to bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.' </p> <p><i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i> is a challenging text, but once encountered and absorbed, it cannot be forgotten for both its content and style. </p> <p>Translation: Thomas Common - revised and updated. </p>";
