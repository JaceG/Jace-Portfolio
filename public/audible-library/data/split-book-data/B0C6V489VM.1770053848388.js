window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Finally, a solution to toxic politics!</p> <p>Representative democracies in the US and around the world are in trouble. Due to the political divide and political party extremism, people are upset, and looking for a government that better serves them. Books and articles are rife with blame, but no realistic, actionable solution has been put forth. Minor changes have been proposed such as term limits and multi-voting. However, no one has examined the root cause of the problem, much less developed a practical solution to toxic, destructive politics that incite hate and violence. Until now....</p> <p>Brent Naseath approached the problem through his many years as a consultant to some of the largest companies in the US. Using his tried and true process for solving very large, complex problems, he has developed a realistic solution to the root cause of political division, corruption, and of most other political problems. More effective laws, policies, and other governing decisions would result than occur now.</p> <p>This book contains more than a good idea. It describes specific, realistic changes to two key federal processes that will solve toxic, destructive politics, complete with an action plan. If we the people choose to implement this plan, the dawn of a new, more prosperous era with actual equality could be only a few years away. We the people could finally have a voice in government and in our future without waiting for permission from political parties, politicians, and the elite and special interests who fund them.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
