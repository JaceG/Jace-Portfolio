window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Personal and professional networks shape everything we do. A chance meeting with an old colleague leads to a swanky new job; two businessmen collaborate online and cofound a successful start-up; a friend introduces a promising entrepreneur to a millionaire looking to invest. In this practical guide to discovering the rules of our superconnected world, the authors show that success is less about who you are than how you connect. With an eye toward business applications, Superconnect outlines the new rules of our densely linked society. At the core of the analysis are three simple network components - strong relationships, weak relationships, and hubs - that interact in surprising, counterintuitive ways. Understanding how these components mesh, and connecting unrelated people, is the way to achieve in today’s hyper-connected world.</p>";
