Suppose that different interviewers at the same firm make different decisions about indistinguishable job applicants—or that when a company is handling customer complaints, the resolution depends on who happens to answer the phone. Now imagine that the same doctor, the same judge, the same interviewer, or the same customer service agent makes different decisions depending on whether it is morning or afternoon, or Monday rather than Wednesday. These are examples of noise: variability in judgments that should be identical.<br> <br>In <i>Noise</i>, Daniel Kahneman, Olivier Sibony, and Cass R. Sunstein show the detrimental effects of noise in many fields, including medicine, law, economic forecasting, forensic science, bail, child protection, strategy, performance reviews, and personnel selection. Wherever there is judgment, there is noise. Yet, most of the time, individuals and organizations alike are unaware of it. They neglect noise. With a few simple remedies, people can reduce both noise and bias, and so make far better decisions.<br> <br>Packed with original ideas, and offering the same kinds of research-based insights that made <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow </i>and <i>Nudge</i> groundbreaking <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, <i>Noise</i> explains how and why humans are so susceptible to noise in judgment—and what we can do about it.<br><br><i>Cover design © HarperCollins Publishers 2021</i><br><br><br><b>* This audiobook contains a downloadable PDF which includes figures from the book. <br></b>";
