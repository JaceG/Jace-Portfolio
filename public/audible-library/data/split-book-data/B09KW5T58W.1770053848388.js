window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Some of us go weak in the knees for silky, buttery Brie. </p> <p>Some of us consume stinky, washed-rind cheeses like French Muenster with great pride. </p> <p>Some of us can’t imagine a plate of pasta without a hurricane of grated Parmigiano Reggiano. </p> <p>But cheese is more than just a snack or finishing touch. It’s a world unto itself. Cheese has been a part of the human experience for thousands of years, and it has so much to teach us - about history, microbiology, cultural differences (and commonalities), and the complex workings of our senses. Not to mention, it’s just incredibly delicious. </p> <p>Think of <i>Cultured: A World History of Cheese</i> as a 10-episode cheese course, or a cheese plate large enough to contain a well-rounded sampling of great cheeses from around the world. Janet Fletcher, a noted food writer and publisher of the Planet Cheese blog, provides deeper (and delectable) insights into a familiar food you only think you know. Included in this Audible Original are peeks at the nine steps of cheesemaking, the 10 most important cheese families, and tips on how to taste cheese with the same refined palate as a professional cheese judge. </p> <p>(And yes, you have our permission to snack on your favorite cheeses while you listen.)</p>";
