window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>What did the Founding Fathers think about religion? And why did a group of practicing Protestants create a republic with widespread religious liberty? The 12 lectures included in this fascinating course provide multi-layered insights into the vision, philosophies, politics, and deep-seated faith of these brilliant leaders - in their own time, in their own words.</p> <p>Listeners will examine the unorthodox religious journeys of men like George Washington, Ben Franklin, Thomas Paine, and John Jay, as well as the profound and passionate faiths of John Adams, Patrick Henry, and Benjamin Rush. They’ll also explore the ways in which the Founders thought about mixing religion with political power, from establishing national fast days to disestablishing state churches.</p> <p>Along the way, listeners will hear about the profound changes religious freedom created in America. <i>The Faith and the Founding Fathers</i> is the story of how liberty and religion wrestled with each other at the birth of the republic and created the forms and traditions of modern American religion.</p> <p>Through these 12 lectures, listeners will come to fully understand the philosophies of the Founding Fathers as they:</p> <ul> <li>Investigate how religion responded to the American Revolution</li> <li>Travel back to pre-revolutionary American religion and encounter the renegades of the Great Awakening and the tenets of Puritans and Deists</li> <li>Learn how the American Revolution was influenced by the beliefs of everyone from John Adams to Charles Carroll</li> <li>Discover how religious liberty became enshrined as law</li> <li>Examine surprising effects of religious liberty that the Founding Fathers never anticipated, including the rise of new forms of Christianity and American revivalism</li> <li>Follow the rapid expansion of African American Christianity among both free and enslaved communities</li> </ul> <p>Despite how far removed the faiths of the Founding Fathers are from us in the 21st century, Dr. Jortner’s explorations of their philosophies offer illuminating insights into modern politics, religious liberty, and the overarching role of religion in human civilization. </p>";
