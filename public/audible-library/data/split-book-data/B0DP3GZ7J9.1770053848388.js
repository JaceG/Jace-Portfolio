window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imaginative play is a crucial part of growing up. It has a major impact on cognitive, emotional, and intellectual development. It’s also a joyous activity that gifts us with some of our fondest and most resilient childhood memories. Toys and games have long been a part of childhood, but the 20th century saw the rise of an entire industry devoted to the business of play, one that would constantly evolve over the years to reflect the rapid changes of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p> <p>In the six lectures of <i>The History of Toys, 1900 to the Present</i>, consultant and toy industry expert Chris Byrne—also known as The Toy Guy®—will take you on a journey through the world of toys from the Edwardian era to our current moment. Beginning with the birth of the mass-market toy industry, you’ll trace the many transformations of toys and our shifting theories of play and childhood development. From Lionel Trains and Barbie to G.I. Joe and LEGO® to Tickle Me Elmo, you’ll see how these beloved playthings reflect our ideas—and our ideals—of childhood, reinforce social rules and cultural expectations, showcase new technology, and so much more.</p> <p>Toys are no longer just the purview of children and their parents—our love of toys and imaginative play has become a more acceptable part of adult life, too. As you consider both the short-lived fads and the enduring games and gadgets of the past, you’ll see that, while toys and the place they have in our lives may change, one thing remains constant: our human need for play as a tool of discovery, development, and understanding of the world around us.</p>";
