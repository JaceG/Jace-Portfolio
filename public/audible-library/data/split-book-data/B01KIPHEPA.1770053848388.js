window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jenny Blake, author of <i>Life After College</i> and former career development program manager at Google, reveals how to methodically make your next career move by doubling down on what is already working. </p> <p>Careers are not linear, predictable ladders any longer; they are fluid trajectories. No matter our age, life stage, bank account balance, or seniority, we are all being asked to navigate career changes much more frequently than in years past. The average employee tenure in America is just four to five years, and even those roles change dramatically within that time. Our economy now demands that we create businesses and careers based on creativity, growth, and impact. In this dynamic world of work, the only move that matters is your next one. </p> <p>Drawing from her own experiences and those of other successful pivoters, Jenny Blake has created a four-stage process that teaches anyone how to seamlessly and continually: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Double down on existing strengths, interests, and experiences </li> <li>Find new opportunities and identify skills to develop without falling prey to analysis paralysis and compare and despair </li> <li>Run small experiments to determine next steps </li> <li>Take smart risks to launch with confidence in a new direction </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>This book is for anyone searching for an answer to the question \"what's next?\" Whether you have hit a plateau in your perfect-on-paper job, are considering taking on a new role in your current job, are thinking about starting your own business, or want to move into a new industry altogether, one thing remains clear: Your career success depends on your ability to determine your next best move. If change is the only constant, let's get better at it. </p>";
