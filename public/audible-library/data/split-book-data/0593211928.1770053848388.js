window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From the \"Marie Kondo of paper\" comes a simple and accessible guide to paper management.</b></p> <p>Americans are drowning in paper. We keep stacks of it on the kitchen counter, stash it in drawers, and store file cabinets full of documents that we never even look at. Studies show that fully 85 percent of the paper in our lives can be tossed - but which 85 percent? And how do we organize and manage the 15 percent that remains?</p> <p>With <i>The Paper Solution</i>, founder of Organize365 Lisa Woodruff delivers a proven, step-by-step guide for what to shred, what to save, and how to sort what's left behind. With her method, you'll learn: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>What documents you must absolutely hold on to</li> <li>Which papers you can dispose of today</li> <li>How to ditch your bulky filing cabinets and make your vital documents accessible and portable</li> </ul> <p>And at the heart of it all is the Sunday Basket: a box that sits on your counter and corrals those stray bills, forms, coupons, and scraps into an easy-to-use paper-management system. The Sunday Basket will become your new weekly habit - one that leads to less paper, less stress, and more time to spend on the things (and people) that matter most. </p> <p>Includes a PDF containing an appendix of worksheets from the book.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
