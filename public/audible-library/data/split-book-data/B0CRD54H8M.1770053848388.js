window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An invaluable guide for anyone consumed by romantic obsession— as well as the objects of their unwanted desire!</b></p> <p>Millions of otherwise rational and mature men and women are driven to self-defeating, out-of-control behavior by intense, unfulfilled desire. Millions of others—targets of their obsession—find their lives turned upside down by unwanted attention, harassment, and worse.</p> <p>In <i>Obsessive Love</i>, acclaimed therapist Dr. Susan Forward offers crucial help to both obsessors and their targets. Using vivid case histories— drawn largely from her several decades of practice—Dr. Forward outlines the stages of obsessive love—from romance to rejection, from pursuit to revenge. Obsessors learn proven techniques to reduce their torment and to bring self-destructive behavior under control, allowing for the development of healthy new relationships. And the targets of such obsessions are given practical strategies for assertive communication and self-protection.</p>";
