window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Imposter syndrome—the irrational self-doubt we feel despite obvious success—can strike at any time, at work or at home. Such crippling anxiety and worry, common to so many people, can even undermine your ability to lead a confident and authentic life. But when you understand the psychological roots of imposter syndrome, you can equip yourself with the right strategies and mindset to avoid the rabbit hole of fraudulent thinking.</p> <p>In <i>Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</i>, licensed clinical psychologist Kelly Vincent teaches you how to navigate these complicated feelings and how to guide yourself toward lasting change. Through six compassionate and insightful lessons, Kelly unpacks the various types of imposter syndrome (yes, there’s more than one), then reveals proven strategies for rewiring your brain so you can challenge unhelpful thoughts and approach every task with confidence. Along the way, you’ll explore and practice both long-term strategies, such as regulating your nervous system, and short-term strategies, such as in-the-moment coping methods.</p> <p>Is that ugly imposter voice in your head getting too loud? Now, with this Audible Original, you can tell it to keep quiet.</p>";
