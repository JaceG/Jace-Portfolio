window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>B Corps are part of a global movement of more than 2,700 companies in 60 countries - like Patagonia, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Kickstarter, Danone North America, and Eileen Fisher - that are using the power of business as a force for good. B Corps have been certified to have met rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. This audiobook is the authoritative guide to the what, why, and how of B Corp certification. </p> <p>Coauthors Ryan Honeyman and Dr. Tiffany Jana spoke with the leaders of more than 200 B Corps from around the world to get their insights on becoming a certified B Corp, improving their social and environmental performance, and building a more inclusive economy. The second edition has been completely revised and updated to include a much stronger focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). These changes are important because DEI can no longer be a side conversation - it must be a core value for any company that aspires to make money and make a difference. </p> <p>While this audiobook is framed around the B Corp movement, any company, regardless of size, industry, or location, can use the tools contained here to learn how to build a better business. As the authors vividly demonstrate, using business as a force for good can help you attract and retain the best talent, distinguish your company in a crowded market, and increase trust in your brand.</p>";
