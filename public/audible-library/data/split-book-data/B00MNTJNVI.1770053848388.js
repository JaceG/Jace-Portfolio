window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>At some point today you will have to influence or persuade someone - your boss, a co-worker, a customer, your spouse, your kids, or even your friends. What is the smallest change you can make to your request or situation that will lead to the biggest difference in the outcome? In <i>The Small Big</i>, three heavyweights from the world of persuasion science and practice describe how, in today's information overloaded and stimulation saturated world, increasingly it is the small changes that you make that lead to the biggest differences. In the last few years, more research-from fields such as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and behavioral economics-has helped to uncover an even greater understanding of how influence, persuasion, and behavior change happens. </p> <p><i>The Small Big</i> presents lots of small changes that can bring about momentous shifts in results. Anyone can significantly increase his or her ability to influence and persuade others, not by informing or educating people into change but by simply making small shifts in approach that link to deeply felt human motivations.</p>";
