window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most organizational books on the market profess to have a one-size-fits-all solution to home organization. </p> <p>Common anthems are to: go paperless, get rid of everything that doesn't spark joy, and capsulize your wardrobe. While some find success using these methods, the majority of American women are facing decades of delayed decisions piled high in unmarked boxes and shoved in storage rooms bursting at the seams. Fifteen-minute-a-day organization tips and color coordinated plastic boxes are no match for the memories and clutter contained in those rooms. </p> <p>What is needed is a complete mindset shift. It's time to look at home organization in a whole new way. Each phase of a woman's life brings unique organizational challenges and emotional clutter to tackle. Looking at a women's life as a journey through four distinct phases of life provides a framework to anchor basic organization principals. </p> <p>\"This is the home organization book that will make the rest of the books in your collection make sense.\" - Lisa Woodruff, Professional Organizer and Productivity Expert. </p> <p>As a professional organizer and productivity specialist, Lisa Woodruff has helped hundreds of women in Cincinnati, Ohio and thousands of women around the world, get their homes organized and keep them that way. Her book <i>The Mindset of Organization</i> encourages women to take back their homes one phase at a time. Find out more at www.organize365.com/mindset </p>";
