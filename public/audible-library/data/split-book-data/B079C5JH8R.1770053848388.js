window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Every year, millions of withdrawn little girls and chronically overwhelmed women go undiagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder because they don't fit the stereotypical profile: they're not fast-talking, hyperactive, or inattentive, and they are not male.</p> <p>Sari Solden's groundbreaking study reveals that ADHD affects just as many women as men, and that the resulting depression, disorganization, anxiety, and underachievement are also symptoms of ADHD.</p> <p>Newly revised and updated to reflect the latest clinical research, the book explores treatment and counseling options, and uses real-life case histories to examine the special challenges women with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) face, such as the shame of not fulfilling societal expectations.</p> <p>Included is a brand-new chapter on friendship for women with ADHD. Three empowering steps - restructuring one's life, renegotiating relationships, and redefining self-image - help women take control of their lives and enjoy success on their own terms.</p>";
